# About this app

This app aims to simplify decisions by breaking them down into many comparisons between two choices. I built it to help name our baby. I found it hard to answer the open-ended question: what should we name our son? It was much easier to make decisions between two choices.

It relies on [Trueskill](http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html) to take your selections and turn them into rankings. The more pairwise comparisons you make, the more accurate the rankings.
